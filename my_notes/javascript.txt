different types of error in javascript

Syntax Errors : Syntax errors are also known as parsing errors.  In JavaScript, they occur at the interpretation time.
Consider this code segment:
 <script type=''text/javascript''>
    window.show(;
  </script>
  
Runtime Errors : These type of error occurs during the runtime of the program, after it is interpreted by the compiler.

Consider this code segment:

 <script type=''text/javascript''>
    window.show();
  </script>

TypeError — my number two as far as occurrence in development is concerned. Thrown when we have some value and it is not of a proper type.

example : const someBoolen = true;
someBoolen.slice(-1); //Error : uncaught typeError : someBoolen slice is not a function.

ReferenceError — thrown when we want to refer to some variable that doesn’t exist.  

example : const name= recievedName; //error : uncaught ReferenceError .recievedName is not defined.

RangeError  : thrown when a value is not in an allowed range.

example : Number('5').toFixed(102); //error : uncaught RangeError.toFixed digit argument must be 0 to 100.

difference between cookies , localstorage and session storage

LocalStorage

Stores data with no expiration date, and gets cleared only through JavaScript, or clearing the Browser cache / Locally Stored Data

Storage limit is the maximum amongst the three

localStorage.setItem('myCat', 'Tom');

var cat = localStorage.getItem('myCat');

localStorage.removeItem('myCat');

localStorage.clear();

SessionStorage

The sessionStorage object stores data only for a session, meaning that the data is stored until the browser (or tab) is closed.

Data is never transferred to the server.

Storage limit is larger than a cookie (at least 5MB).

sessionStorage.setItem('key', 'value');

let data = sessionStorage.getItem('key');

sessionStorage.removeItem('key');

sessionStorage.clear();

Cookie

Stores data that has to be sent back to the server with subsequent requests. Its expiration varies based on the type and the expiration duration can be set from either server-side or client-side (normally from server-side).

Cookies are primarily for server-side reading (can also be read on client-side), localStorage and sessionStorage can only be read on client-side.

Size must be less than 4KB.

Cookies can be made secure by setting the httpOnly flag as true for that cookie. This prevents client-side access to that cookie

In order to delete a cookie set the expires date to something in the past.

document.cookie = "name=oeschger";
document.cookie = "favorite_food=tripe";

document.cookie = "user=John; path=/; expires=Tue, 19 Jan 2038 03:14:07 GMT"
