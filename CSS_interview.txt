Q : What is Box Model : 

A : All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

	Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
	Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
	Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
