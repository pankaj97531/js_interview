What is cors :

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP headers to tell a browser to let a web application running at one origin (domain) have permission to access selected resources from a server at a different origin. A web application executes a cross-origin HTTP request when it requests a resource that has a different origin (domain, protocol, and port) than its own origin.

What is pure function.

A pure function doesn't depend on and doesn't modify the states of variables out of its scope. Concretely, that means a pure function always returns the same result given same parameters. Its execution doesn't depend on the state of the system. Pure functions are a pillar of functional programming.

What is function composition.

answer : Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. Composing functions together is like snapping together a series of pipes for our data to flow through.

pseudo selectors in css

A Pseudo class in CSS is used to define the special state of an element. It can be combined with a CSS selector to add an effect to existing elements based on their states. For Example, changing the style of an element when the user hovers over it, or when a link is visited. All of these can be done using Pseudo Classes in CSS.

Note that pseudo-class names are not case-sensitive.

:hover Pseudo-class: T

:active Pseudo-class

:focus Pseudo-class

:visited Pseudo-class:

A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.

p::first-line {
  color: blue;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

difference between display none and visibility : hidden

display:none means that the tag in question will not appear on the page at all (although you can still interact with it through the dom). There will be no space allocated for it between the other tags.

visibility:hidden means that unlike display:none, the tag is not visible, but space is allocated for it on the page. The tag is rendered, it just isn't seen on the page.
